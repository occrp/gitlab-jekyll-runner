# Gitlab CI Hugo runner

A Gitlab CI runner docker image for generating Hugo-managed static sites. Based on the great [`gitlab-ci-multi-runner`](https://hub.docker.com/r/sameersbn/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/), and inspired by [`docker-hugo`](https://github.com/jojomi/docker-hugo/blob/master/Dockerfile).
